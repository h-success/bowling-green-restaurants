The map is a visualization of the various restaurants located in Bowling Green, KY. Each green point on the map represents a restaurant. 317 different restaurants are on this map. The map uses geocoding.

The final map will show how many restaurants are privately owned (local) or are corporately owned (part of a franchise). I may use a heatmap to demonstrate this and also use different shapes to represent whether the restaurant is brick/mortar (stationed at a single physical location) or is a food truck.

The data used for this map was an excel file containing the restaurants that have an occupational license through the local city government.

Since the data within the excel file was accurate as of April 2019, I also used data from the Bowling Green Area Convention & Visitors Bureau and the Bowling Green Area Chamber of Commerce which contains information about different restaurants in Bowling Green, KY. Additionally, I used Google to manually search information on these different restaurants in order to confirm that these restaurants were still active and to determine whether the restaurant was privately owned or part of a franchise. Local restaurants where the owner has only one restaurant were identified as a 'privately owned restaurant.' Restaurants where identified as being a 'local chain restaurant' if the local restaurant owners had more than one restaurant and did not have a restaurant located in more than two states. Restaurants that were a part of a franchise were listed as 'corporate.'

The map was created using the software QGIS 3.14.16 and using ESRI Server data harvested from the MMQGIS plugin.
